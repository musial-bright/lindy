Processing Skatch 'Lindy'
http://www.processing.org

A painting I did once is converted into a matrix of lines pointing to the z axis - so towards the viewer.
Usage:
- Let the image follow the cursor
- By pressing the mouse button in different sketch edges, the picture turns.
- Zoom the image in by pressing the mouse buttoninthe sketch center.
